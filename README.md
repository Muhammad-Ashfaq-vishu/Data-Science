# 📊 My Data Science Journey – From Scratch

Welcome to my Data Science Journey! This repository serves as a structured and documented roadmap of my learning over the next **9 months**, as I progress from foundational concepts to advanced topics in data science.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a strong foundation in data science concepts and tools  
- Build practical skills through hands-on coding and real-world projects  
- Track and reflect on progress with monthly learning logs  
- Share resources and code to support other learners in the community
