# 📊 My Data Science Journey – From Scratch

Welcome to my Data Science Journey! This repository is my personal learning space where I will document everything I learn as I dive deep into data science over the next **9 months** – from absolute basics to advanced topics.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in data science
- Practice consistently with hands-on coding and real-world projects
- Track my monthly progress and reflect on my growth
- Share notes and code that can help others starting their own journey
